## K means:
- average of the squared distances from each point to the centroid of the cluster it belongs to,which represents the compactness of all clusters.

- The goal is to minimize this average across all data points to ensure that each point is as close as possible to the center of its cluster, which in turn makes the clusters more cohesive and well-separated.
